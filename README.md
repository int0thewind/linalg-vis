* (TODO) Show original coordinate grid lines on transformed coordinate system
* Calculate matrix determinants, rank, and show its properties
* Show multiple transformed objects. Object including:
    * Vector
    * (TODO) Circle/Ellipse
    * (TODO) Rectangles
    * (TODO) (challenging) custom SVG with path specified
